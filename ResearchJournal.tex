\section{Introduction}
Human computer interaction is an integral part of most software, including video games, as the users' successful interaction with the system is a key goal. Because of this, it is important to ensure that systems are intuitive and easy to use, allowing new users to interact without problems. Usability testing is therefore a vital part of software development to ensure the system usability is sufficient. 

This journal will examine several methods of usability testing, discussing their benefits and costs, as well as comparing their appropriateness to be used to research the usability of the Demiurge video game combat system.

\section{Game}
Demiurge is a third person bullet-hell game, in which the player must dodge projectiles or reflect them with their shield, while simultaneously attempting to aim their own projectiles to eliminate enemies. The game is a prototype produced by a team of students.


\section{Methods}

\subsection{Think Aloud}
Think aloud testing is a basic but powerful form of usability testing where the users interact with the system while narrating their thoughts out loud for the observer to record. This gives deep insight into the users' personal way of interacting with the system and quickly highlights areas of confusion or frustration.

This method is also cheap and easy to perform, requiring only an observer, the users and the system, which can make it a good starting point to eliminate problems before considering more complex tests.


\subsection{Eyetracking}
For more technical data about the system, eyetracking tests can be conducted to discover how the user interacts with the interface at a deeper level. This method can help observers to understand the data from a think aloud or similar test, by showing observers what the user was looking at while using the system. It is difficult for people to explain their thought process, as they can process thoughts far faster than they can articulate them. Monitoring eye movements gives an insight into the thought process, as people tend to be thinking about what they are looking at. \cite{eyeTracking}

As Demiurge is a fast-paced combat game, the ability to track player eye movements could help the developers understand how players gather information from the game, which could be used to inform UI design (to ensure it does not cover important areas of the screen) and combat elements, such as the range from which projectiles can be shot at the player.

However, eyetracking tests require specialised equipment, which is both expensive and needs training to use correctly. As the Demiurge team is a small group of students in a non-commercial environment, high-cost equipment would not be a practical method of testing despite its benefits.


\subsection{Surveys}
Surveys are a versatile method of data collection that can be tailored to suit any part of the system being tested. Of the largest benefits of surveys is their potential for collecting large amounts of data. As they do not require an observer or specialised equipment, they can be used to assess large groups of users, both in a testing environment, but also as continual testing after release, as surveys can be completed remotely by users. Larger data sets provide greater opportunities to find meaningful trends and patterns that can be used to identify issues that effect a broad spectrum of users.
